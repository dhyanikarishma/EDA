# Overview
This project analyzes trip data of 1,000+ entries to extract insights on travel patterns, pricing trends, and popular destinations. The analysis involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations, uncovering key findings such as peak travel periods and fare outliers.

# Tools and Libraries
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn

# Key Findings
Peak Travel Periods: Identified busiest times for travel.
Pricing Trends: Detected fare outliers and seasonal variations.
Popular Destinations: Mapped frequently visited locations.

# Future Work
Expand analysis to larger datasets.
Use machine learning to predict travel trends.
